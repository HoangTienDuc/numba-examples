This release also fully accommodates new and changed functionality required to be compatible with NumPy 1.16.\n",

Extensive documentation including examples, recommendations and removal schedules can be [found here](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/reference/deprecation.html). The deprecations/pending deprecations most likely to impact your code relate to:\n",
