    "Literal value support\n",
    "------------------------------\n",
    "Numba 0.41.0 has a significant change made to the typing system that aims to clean up the use of constants. This change takes the form of support for type specific literal values in the type inference mechanism. During typing two passes are now made, the first with anything which is a constant and can expressed as a literal set as such (integers, strings, slices and `make_function` are implemented as literals at present), the second with the standard types used for the constants. This, for example, permits value based dispatch as demonstrated below, but also opens up a lot of future possibilities surrounding typing which were inaccessible prior to this change."
