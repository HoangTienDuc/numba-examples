    "# A Year of Numba (the year 2018!)\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot changed in Numba throughout 2018, this notebook aims to show some of the highlights. A key driver of a large number of the changes made this year has been direct response to feedback provided by the Numba users community. The core development team are very grateful for such excellent feedback and would like to thank everyone who has contributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, online help over IRC is available on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/numba/numba) and issues for bugs/questions/feature requests are welcome on [Github](https://github.com/numba/numba/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Updates to Numba's dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numba now supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.4-3.7. Typically one release cycle is  all that is\n",
    "  required to adopt a new 3.x Python version.\n",
    "* Numba (via llvmlite) is now backed by LLVM 7.0. Three LLVM releases have been used to back Numba this year, 5, 6 and 7. Again, it is typical for only a single release cycle to be required to adopt a new LLVM version.\n",
    "* CUDA 8.0 is now the minimum supported CUDA version.\n",
    "\n",
    "## New NumPy function support:\n",
    "These are not going to be demonstrated in this notebook, but it is worth mentioning that somewhere in the order of an additional 30 new NumPy functions/`ndarray` methods (or additional kwarg support) have been added to Numba this year. As always a full list of supported NumPy functionality can be found [in the documentation](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/reference/numpysupported.html). The new for 2018 features are:\n",

    "## Updates to CUDA:\n",
    "A large number of CUDA bugs have been fixed, and the following enhancements made:\n",
    "* Support for FMA and faster float64 atomics on suitable hardware. \n",
    "* Records in const memory\n",
    "* Improved datatime dtype support.\n",
    "* The addition of the `__cuda_array_interface__` member following the NumPy array interface specification to allow Numba to consume externally defined device arrays. This was undertaken in correspondence with CuPy to test out the concept and be able to use CuPy GPU arrays.\n",
    "* Support for the NumPY tranpose API\n",
    "* Permit direct assignment to to DeviceNDArrays\n",
