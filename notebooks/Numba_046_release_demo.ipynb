    "Numba 0.46.0 Release Demo\n",
    "=======================\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook contains a demonstration of new features present in the 0.46.0 release of Numba. Whilst release notes are produced as part of the [`CHANGE_LOG`](<LINK>), there's nothing like seeing code in action! It should be noted that this release does not contain a huge amount of changes to user facing support. A lot of the changes to the code base this time around were to continue to enhance Numba's use as a compiler toolkit and add features for advanced users/developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some exciting news... The Numba team finally started working on, the colloquially named, \"scumba\" project, to add SciPy support in Numba, the [project is called `numba-scipy`](https://github.com/numba/numba-scipy) (it's expected that there may be other `numba-XYZ` projects). This project also demonstrates a new feature added in this release, that Numba now has a formal way to register a project with Numba itself via an auto-discovery mechanism. Read more about this mechanism [here](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/extending/entrypoints.html). A demonstration of ``numba-scipy`` appears later in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For users of Numba, demonstrations of new features include:\n",
    "* [The using SciPy in Numba Jitted functions](#üéâ-Using-SciPy-from-Numba-üéâ)\n",
    "* [Newly supported NumPy functions/features](#Newly-supported-NumPy-functions/features)\n",
    "* [A few new miscellaneous features!](#Miscellaneous-features)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, predominantly for library developers/compiler engineers, new features include:\n",
    "* The addition of the `'inline'` kwarg to both the `@numba.jit` family of decorators and `@numba.extending.overload`.\n",
    "* A new compiler API to permit extension and definition of:\n",
    "  * The compiler itself.\n",
    "  * The compiler pipeline.\n",
    "  * Compiler passes.\n",
    "* Support for module at a time `jit` application.\n",

    "As noted above, the 0.46 release cycle saw the Numba core developers start work on a new community driven project called `numba-scipy`. This project adds support for using SciPy functions in Numba JIT'd code, at present it's in its very infancy but, with thanks to external contributors, some functionality is already present ([docs are here](https://numba-scipy.readthedocs.io/)). Below is an example of using `scipy.special.*` functions in JIT code."
