    "Numba's decorators\n",
    "=============\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is a family of decorators and a couple of special types. We've seen `@njit` already, this is for JIT compiling a function and is in actual fact an alias for `@numba.jit(nopython=True)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some history...\n",
    "A long while ago Numba had the concept of fall-back modes added to JIT compilation, it would do the following:\n",
    "1. Try and compile the function in `nopython` mode, `nopython` mode is what it sounds like, a mode where there is no-python involved, it's all machine code.\n",
    "2. If `nopython` mode failed, Numba would try again compiling in \"loop-lifting\" mode, this is where Numba will scan the code for loops and try and compile those.\n",
    "3. If \"loop-lifting\" mode failed Numba would compile the code into C-API calls, which is not particularly useful and can even be slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently Numba is in the process of deprecating this as it's a headache for compiler engineers and seriously confusing for users as seemingly simple code changes can drastically alter performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the decorators...\n",
    "\n",
    "@vectorize\n",
    "----------\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is built on Universal Functions (\"ufuncs\") as a key concept, these functions perform their operations element wise on the input and handle all the broadcasting over arrays etc. What if you want to define your own ufunc? Meet Numba's `@vectorize`."
